# Show multiples of 2 numbers within a range
Print all numbers up to `3rd` parameter which are multiple of both `1st` and `2nd` parameter.

Python, Javascript, Java, Ruby versions: return results in a list/array

### NOTICE
1. Do NOT worry about checking zeros or negative values.
2. To find out if `3rd` parameter (the upper limit) is inclusive or not, check the tests, it differs in each translation.
